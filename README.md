# Sales-Data-Analysis-Practice
This project analyzes a sample sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. It was created as part of my self-learning journey to practice data cleaning, basic analysis, and generating simple insights from data.

# Objective
Vrinda store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, Vrinda can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023

## Dataset
- <a href="https://bit.ly/3X381ok"> Dataset </a>

## Questions 
1.	Compare the sales and orders using a single chart
2.	Which month get the highest sales and orders?
3.	Who purchases more – men or women?
4.	What are the different order status
5.	List top 10 states contributing to the sales
6.	Relation between age and gender based on number of orders
7.	Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
8.	Highest selling category

## Insights
Based on the analysis made, these are the findings
1.	Women purchased more goods from the store with a figure of 21,553 which is no surprising considering the store was more female-focused
2.	For the order status, Returned showed a significant figure of 1045 which can be alarming because it gives an assumption that there could be a defect of the goods being sold in the store.
3.	MAHARASHTRA has the highest number of purchase made
4.	The analysis showed that the Adults (30 – 49) made the most purchase.
5.	The highest selling category was the “set”
